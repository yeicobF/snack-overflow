                <p>We find ourselves in a world where abundance and scarcity alarmingly coexist. In Mexico, 20.4 million tons of food are wasted every year, equivalent to 38 tons per minute. This is enough to feed 25.5 million people with food shortages. On the other hand, 3 out of every 10 people in Mexico face some degree of food insecurity. At this moment, there are 4.8 million Mexicans who probably have not eaten and perhaps will not do so for the rest of the day.</p>
                <p>How can we help? By donating unsold food or food that is close to its expiration date, we can ensure that these foods reach the people who need them most instead of ending up in the trash. By doing so, we are not only helping to combat hunger, but we are also reducing our environmental impact and making more efficient use of our resources.</p>
                <p>We invite all restaurants, supermarkets, and other food businesses to join us in this initiative. Together, we can make a big difference in the lives of millions of people and help create a more just and sustainable world.</p>
                <p>Join us today and be part of the solution!, <span>donate your food</span></p>
